# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is the `claude-code-showcase` repository containing specialized agents for security and AWS AgentCore analysis, along with a comprehensive development workflow for feature-based development.

## ðŸš¨ MANDATORY WORKFLOW PROTOCOL

### Session Management

**Session Naming Convention**: `.claude/sessions/XXX/overview.md`
- **XXX** = Current Git branch name (e.g., `feature/SWATCA-123-comment-processing`)
- **Purpose**: Easy navigation back to session context across development lifecycle
- **Structure**: Each session contains overview.md + specialized agent findings

### Branch Management Protocol

**Before Starting Any Feature Work**:
1. Check current branch: `git branch --show-current`
2. If on `main` branch:
   - **STOP IMMEDIATELY** - Do not proceed with feature work
   - Instruct user to create feature branch first
   - Verify no uncommitted changes: `git status`
   - Create and switch to feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/SWATCA-XXX-descriptive-name`
3. If on feature branch:
   - Verify branch name follows convention
   - Proceed with session setup

### Phase 1: Task Initialization

1. **Main Agent** starts working on ticket/issue
2. **MANDATORY BRANCH CHECK**: If currently on main branch, STOP and instruct user to create feature branch first
   - Feature branch naming: `feature/CLAUDE-XXX-descriptive-name`
   - Example: `feature/CLAUDE-001-bedrock-lambda-scaffold`
   - **DO NOT PROCEED** until proper feature branch is created and checked out
3. **Create session directory**: `.claude/sessions/[BRANCH_NAME]/`
4. **Create issue file**: `.claude/sessions/[BRANCH_NAME]/issue.md`
5. **Document initial requirements with user in issue.md file**: 
   - Ticket details and acceptance criteria
   - Technical scope and constraints
   - Initial architectural thoughts
6. **Create overview file**: `.claude/sessions/[BRANCH_NAME]/overview.md`
7. **Maintain session in overview.md file**: Update overview.md throughout development process with key findings and decisions from experts

### Phase 2: Expert Consultation

#### Sub-Agent Usage Protocol

1. **Determine which agents are needed** based on the feature requirements
2. **Ask user for agent consultation order** - which agents should be consulted and in what sequence
3. **Invoke agents sequentially** using the simplified protocol
4. **Read and integrate findings** from each agent's analysis file into session overview.d directly after the consultation, before calling the next agent
6. **Proceed with implementation** based on expert guidance, if the user is happy with the overview.md

### Phase 3: Implementation Integration

1. **Review consolidated findings** in overview.md with user
2. **Confirm implementation approach** based on expert recommendations
3. **Integrate changes** collaboratively with user guidance
4. **Update session documentation** with implementation decisions and outcomes
5. **Validate implementation** meets requirements and expert recommendations

### Phase 4: Code Review and Validation

1. **Internal Code Review**: Use internal /review command to compare made changes to the `.claude/sessions/[BRANCH_NAME]/issue.md`
2. **Present findings to user**: Communicate implementation results and any deviations from original plan
3. **User validation**: Confirm implementation meets acceptance criteria before proceeding
4. **Update overview.md**: Document review outcomes and user feedback
5. **Proceed only after user approval**: Do not continue to testing/documentation without explicit user confirmation

### Phase 5: Session Completion and Evolution

1. **Main Agent reviews**: Complete session outcomes in overview.md
2. **Document learnings**: Capture patterns and insights for future sessions
3. **Archive session**: Maintain session files for future reference
4. **Agent evolution**: Note any gaps or improvements needed in agent capabilities. Changes in code, architecture and infrastructure should be present in the `.claude/agents/` experts. With the help of the user update their knowledge.

## Agent Communication Protocol

### SIMPLIFIED AGENT INVOCATION

**Input to Agent**: Provide ONLY the session context file path `.claude/sessions/[BRANCH_NAME]/overview.md` - NO additional context, explanations, or instructions

**Agent Workflow**: Agent reads session data, analyzes project structure, writes ALL findings to analysis file without making changes to the code.

**Output from Agent**: Receive ONLY the findings file path (no summaries, explanations, or additional text)

**Main Agent Action**: Read the comprehensive findings file and integrate into session overview

## Available Sub-Agents

**MANDATORY**: The main agent MUST use the appropriate sub-agents for specific tasks. Each sub-agent has specialized knowledge and capabilities for their domain.

### 1. Security Expert (@security-expert)
- **File**: `.claude/agents/security-expert.md`
- **Use for**: Security vulnerability analysis, threat assessment, defensive security practices
- **Specializes in**: AWS security, encryption, IAM, compliance frameworks, security best practices
- **When to use**: Security analysis, vulnerability assessment, compliance requirements, security architecture
- **Output file**: `.claude/sessions/[BRANCH_NAME]/security-analysis.md`
- **Available tools**: Read, Edit, Write, Grep, TodoWrite
- **Knowledge base**: Comprehensive AWS security practices, encryption standards, threat detection

### 2. AgentCore Expert (@agentcore-expert)
- **File**: `.claude/agents/agentcore-expert.md`
- **Use for**: AWS AgentCore service analysis, agent orchestration, multi-agent workflows
- **Specializes in**: AgentCore Runtime, Identity, Memory, Code Interpreter, Browser, Gateway, Observability
- **When to use**: AgentCore implementations, agent deployment, workflow orchestration, agent system architecture
- **Output file**: `.claude/sessions/[BRANCH_NAME]/agentcore-analysis.md`
- **Available tools**: Read, Edit, Write, Grep, TodoWrite
- **Knowledge base**: Complete AgentCore service documentation, deployment patterns, best practices

## Critical Requirements

- **NEVER proceed with feature work on main branch**
- **ALWAYS create proper feature branches**
- **ALWAYS use session management to communicate with subagents**
- **ALWAYS consult appropriate experts**
- **ALWAYS document findings in session files**
- **ALWAYS consult user at important points**
- **Agents must write ALL findings to analysis files**
- **Agent responses must be file paths only**

## Development Commands
